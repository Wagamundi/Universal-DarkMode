# Universal-DarkMode
A Script for websites, to easily switch between Light and Dark Mode, without hardcoding the elements.

## General Information
  - You have to copy the ".html" Code I provided into your project, not all but the "<section>" "<script>" and "<link>" elements.
  - It scans the Elements at side loading, so if you want it to load them later, just load the script again, or just after you did the other thing.
  - You have to reconfigure the light and dark patches
  - It is styled in my way, so feel free to edit that

## To-Do
  - Add more Patches, because it currently only supports 2
  - If you have any wishes or things I can do better, please tell me.
  - More to come.

## Flaws
  Please report any Flaws/Errors or Bugs to me, so I can make it better.
